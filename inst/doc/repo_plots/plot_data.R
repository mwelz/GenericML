### 1. Data Generation ----
set.seed(31684591)

n  <- 1000                      # number of observations
p  <- 3                         # number of covariates
D  <- rbinom(n, 1, 0.5)         # random treatment assignment
Z  <- matrix(runif(n*p), n, p)  # design matrix
colnames(Z) <- paste0("z", 1:p) # column names
Y0 <- as.numeric(Z %*% rexp(p)) # potential outcome without treatment

## simulate heterogeneous treatment effect
# treatment effect increases with Z1, has a level shift along Z2 (at 0.5), and has no pattern along Z3
HTE <- 2 * Z[,1] + ifelse(Z[,2] >= 0.5, 1, -1)
ATE <- mean(HTE)                # average treatment effect (about 0.979 here)
Y1  <- HTE + Y0                 # potential outcome under treatment
Y   <- ifelse(D == 1, Y1, Y0)   # observed outcome


### 2. Prepare the arguments for GenericML() ----

# quantile cutoffs for the GATES grouping of the estimated CATEs
quantile_cutoffs <- c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75) # 25%, 50%, and 75% quantiles

# specify the learner of the propensity score (non-penalized logistic regression here). Propensity scores can also directly be supplied.
learner_propensity_score <- "mlr3::lrn('glmnet', lambda = 0, alpha = 1)"

# specify the considered learners of the BCA and the CATE (here: lasso, random forest, and SVM)
learners_GenericML <- c("lasso", "mlr3::lrn('ranger', num.trees = 100)", "mlr3::lrn('svm')")

# specify the data that shall be used for the CLAN
# here, we use all variables of Z and uniformly distributed random noise
Z_CLAN <- cbind(Z, random = runif(n))

# specify the number of splits (many to rule out seed-dependence of results)
num_splits <- 1000

# specify if a HT transformation shall be used when estimating BLP and GATES
HT <- FALSE

# A list controlling the variables that shall be used in the matrix X1 for the BLP and GATES regressions.
X1_BLP   <- setup_X1()
X1_GATES <- setup_X1()

# consider differences between group K (most affected) with groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
diff_GATES <- setup_diff(subtract_from = "most",
                         subtracted = 1:3)
diff_CLAN  <- setup_diff(subtract_from = "most",
                         subtracted = 1:3)

# specify the significance level
significance_level <- 0.05

# specify minimum variation of predictions before Gaussian noise with variance var(Y)/20 is added.
min_variation <- 1e-05

# specify which estimator of the error covariance matrix shall be used in BLP and GATES (standard OLS covariance matrix estimator here)
vcov_BLP   <- setup_vcov()
vcov_GATES <- setup_vcov()

# ensure that GATES parameters are monotonically increasing (required by theory)
monotonize <- TRUE

# the package allows for stratified sampling (don't use it here by keeping the arguments empty)
stratify <- setup_stratify()

# specify that there are no external weights to be used in the analysis
external_weights <- NULL

# specify the proportion of samples that shall be selected in the auxiliary set
prop_aux <- 0.5

# specify whether or not the splits and auxiliary results of the learners shall be stored
store_splits   <- TRUE
store_learners <- FALSE # to save memory

# parallelization options (currently only supported on Unix systems)
parallel  <- TRUE
num_cores <- 8      # 8 cores
seed      <- 123456
# Note that the number of cores influences the random number stream. Thus, different choices of `num_cores` may lead to different results.


### 3. Run the GenericML() functions with these arguments ----
